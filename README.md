# Google ROADEF/EURO challenge 2011-2012

The aim of this challenge is to improve the usage of a set of machines. A machine has several resources as for example RAM and CPU, and runs processes which consume these resources. Initially each process is assigned to a machine. In order to improve machine usage, processes can be moved from one machine to another. Possible moves are limited by hard constraints, as for example resource capacity constraints, and have a cost. A solution to this problem is a new process-machine assignment which satisfies all hard constraints and minimizes a given objective cost.
